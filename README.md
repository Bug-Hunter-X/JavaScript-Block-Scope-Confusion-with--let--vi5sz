# JavaScript Block Scope Confusion

This repository demonstrates a common source of confusion in JavaScript: block scope and variable shadowing using the `let` keyword.

The `bug.js` file contains code that showcases this issue.  The solution, demonstrating how to resolve the shadowing issue, is in `bugSolution.js`.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` files in a text editor or IDE.
3. Run each file using a JavaScript interpreter (Node.js, browser's console, etc.).

## Learning Points

- Understanding block scope and how it differs from function scope.
- Avoiding accidental variable shadowing.
- Best practices for naming variables to prevent this issue.
